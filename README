clj-redis-session uses redis as a Clojure/Ring's HTTP session storage
engine. What makes it different is its support for hierarchical data
storage.

Installation
============

Add

  [clj-redis-session "0.0.1"]

to dependencies in your project.clj.

Usage
=====

clj-redis-session is a drop-in replacement for Ring native stores:

  (ns hello
    (:use [clj-redis-session.core :only [redis-store]]
          [clj-redis.client :only [redis])

  (def store (redis/init {:url "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"}))
  (def app
    (-> ....
      ... other middlewares ...
      (wrap-session {:store (redis-store store)})
      ....))

Why clj-redis-session
=====================

The reason I wrote clj-redis-session is the only redis backed sesssion
store I could find, https://github.com/paraseba/rrss, doesn't support
hierarchical data structure, e.g. lists, maps (actually any
*print-str*able clojure data).
